        <h1>Welcome to My Simple Website</h1>
        <p>Hello! This is a brief paragraph about myself. My name is [Raji], and I'm passionate about technology and web development. I'm currently on an exciting journey of learning how to create websites from scratch. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring nature trails, reading science fiction novels, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I believe in continuous learning and pushing my boundaries, which is why I've embarked on this web development adventure. Through this website, I hope to share my progress, insights, and the occasional challenge I encounter along the way. Feel free to explore and join me on this learning journey!</p>
